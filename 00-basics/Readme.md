# 00 – Basics 🧠

Welcome to the **Basics** section of this DSA journey 👋  
This folder builds the **core thinking skills** required for solving any DSA problem.

If you skip fundamentals, DSA feels hard.  
If you master fundamentals, DSA becomes logical.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This section focuses on:
- Understanding **how to think** before coding
- Learning how to **analyze time & space**
- Building comfort with **loops, math, and recursion**
- Developing a **problem-solving mindset**

📌 If you're a beginner → **start here**  
📌 If you're revising → **skim + reinforce**

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- ✅ Time Complexity
- ✅ Space Complexity
- ✅ Loops & Iterations
- ✅ Mathematical Thinking for DSA
- ✅ Recursion Basics
- ✅ Dry Run Techniques

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts You MUST Understand

### 1️⃣ Time Complexity
- What is Big-O notation
- How loops affect performance
- Why O(n) is better than O(n²)

Example:
```ts
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  // O(n)
}
```
### 2️⃣ Space Complexity
- Difference between input space & auxiliary space
- Why recursion used extra space
- In-place vs extra memory solutions

### 3️⃣ Mathematical Thinking 

You don’t need advanced math ❌
You DO need:
- Patterns
- Series
- Logical reasoning

Example:
`` sum of first N numbers = n*(N+1)/2 ``

### 4️⃣ Loops & Flow Control

Understanding:

- for, while
- break, continue
- Nested loops and their cost

### 5️⃣ Recursion (Intro)

- Base case
- Recursive case
- Stack behavior

👉 Recursion = function calling itself carefully

### 🏃 Practice Challenge

Try this before moving on:

- Write a loop-based solution
- Optimize it
- Analyze time & space
- Convert it to TypeScript
- Explain it in your own words

### 🧠 Mindset Reminder

***“DSA is not about writing code fast. It’s about thinking clearly.”***

Take your time here — this folder decides how strong you’ll become later.
