# DSA journey with TypeScript

***"DSA is not about memorizing solutions, it's about learning how to think."***

Welcome 👋
This repository document my **daily journey of mastering Data Structures & Algorithms** usin **TypeScript**

🎯 **Goal**: 
 - Build strong problem-solving skills
 - Help beginners learn DSA step by step 

If you're someone starting DSA or revising fundamentals, feel free to **learn along with me**  🙂

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

You can follow this repo in 3 ways:

### 👶 Beginner
- Start from `00-Basics`
- Read folder `README.md`
- Solve problems before seeing solutions, if you're stuck read the approach

### 🧑‍💻 Intermediate
- Pick a topic you're weak at
- Read the approach + optimized solutions

### 🧠 Revision Mode
- Skim solutions
- Focus on time & complexity

## 🛣️ Learning Roadmap

- [x] Arrays
- [ ] Strings
- [ ] HashMap
- [ ] Recursion
- [ ] Linked List
- [ ] Stack & Queue
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Dynamic Programming

## 📅 Daily Progress Log

To see the daily progress check the progess log in `progress.md`
📌 I try to solve **at least one problem every day**.
📌 Consistency > Quantity.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a **DSA topic**.

Inside each folder:
- `README.md` → concepts + patterns
- `.ts` files → clean, optimized solutions
- `.js` files → corresponding js files.
- Each solution includes:
  - Approach
  - Time Complexity
  - Space Complexity

## 🧪 Example Solution Format

```ts
/**
 * Problem: Running Sum of 1D Array
 * Approach: Prefix sum
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(1)
 */
```

## 🏃 Practice Along Challenge

Try this:
- 🟢 Solve 1 problem per day
- 🟢 Commit your solution
- 🟢 Track progress weekly

If you’re consistent for 30 days, you’ll notice a **huge improvement**.
